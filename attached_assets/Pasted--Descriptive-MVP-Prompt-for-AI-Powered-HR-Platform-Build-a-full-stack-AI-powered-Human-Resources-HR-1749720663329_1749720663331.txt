 Descriptive MVP Prompt for AI-Powered HR Platform
Build a full-stack AI-powered Human Resources (HR) platform MVP that demonstrates the core functionalities of a next-gen, intelligent HR assistant. The platform should have 8 key modules, each simulating a critical part of the HR workflow using mock data, basic AI logic, and a simple, clean UI.

üß© Modules to Implement in the MVP:
1. Resume Screening Bot
A chatbot or form where the recruiter uploads multiple resumes (PDF/text format) and provides a sample job description.

Use basic NLP (e.g., keyword/semantic matching) to extract relevant skills and experiences from resumes.

Output a ranked shortlist of top 3 candidates with a score and reasoning.

Simulate interaction with a chatbot for asking initial screening questions.

2. Smart Talent Sourcing
Input: A job description or role title.

Output: Display 5 mock candidate profiles sourced from public platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, etc. (simulate with dummy JSON data).

Show relevance score based on keyword matching and simple ML similarity scoring (can be hardcoded logic).

3. Leadership Potential Identifier
Load mock employee performance data (KPIs, peer feedback, training engagement).

Run a rule-based or basic ML model to predict ‚ÄúHigh-Potential‚Äù employees.

Show a list of identified employees with suggested growth actions (e.g., mentorship, fast-track leadership programs).

4. AI-Driven Appraisal Dashboard
Upload or use pre-loaded performance review feedback.

Use sentiment analysis or scoring logic to visualize employee performance in a dashboard (charts or tables).

Show appraisal score trend and qualitative performance summary.

5. Gamified Learning Module
A mock LMS with 3‚Äì5 learning modules.

Users can take a simple quiz per module.

Award points based on correct answers, and maintain a leaderboard of top learners.

Gamify with badges/levels (icons/labels).

6. Skill Gap Analysis
Let user input their current skills (via checklist or form).

Compare against skill requirements for selected roles.

Show ‚ÄúSkill Gaps‚Äù and recommend 3 upskilling resources or courses (from mock course list).

Highlight urgency/severity of each skill gap.

7. Employee Wellness Tracker
A conversational chatbot that asks users a few mental wellness check-in questions (stress, sleep, focus, etc.).

Use rule-based scoring to assess well-being status (e.g., green/yellow/red).

Suggest wellness activities (like a break, meditation, HR contact).

8. Unified HR Insights Dashboard
Load mock HR data (attendance, attrition logs, surveys).

Show a visual dashboard with:

Attrition trends

Absenteeism patterns

Engagement levels

Diversity statistics (optional)

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Tools:
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS (clean UI, responsive layout)

Backend: Node.js with Express or Flask (lightweight server)

AI Logic:

Resume Parsing & Sentiment: Use simple NLP (Python‚Äôs spaCy or JS natural)

Leadership/Gap Prediction: Rule-based logic or mock ML model

Data Storage: Mock JSON files or in-memory objects

Optional: SQLite or Firebase for persistent storag
